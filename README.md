# work-time-calculator

At my part time web design job I am often making small edits and therefore sometimes clocking a few minutes at a time, which add up over time.  I wrote a quick program to take all of those minutes that I copied and pasted from my text file, and add them up, dividing them into hours and minutes.  The program loops throug the array of time, adds up all of the hours and minutes, then outputs the total hours into the console. 

This can probably be accomplished in a spreadsheet too, but because I was logging everything in a text file. I decided to just copy and paste everything the way I wrote it, then write a program to do the arithmatic for me.
